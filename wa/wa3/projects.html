    <h2 tabindex="2">The Aero-Buff</h2>
    <section tabindex="3">
            <p>For my Design Foundations class, we were tasked with
               creating a potential monument for CU's campus. My group
               went with a statue of a Buffalo that had rocket wings
               and a pilot's helmet to give recognition to the aerospace
               engineering department and put a statue in an area that
               doesn't have a lot.

    <h2 tabindex="4">The Arachnoball</h2>
    <section tabindex="5">
        <p>Also in my Design Foundations class, myself and a couple of
           other students were told to create a new toy that might be
           able to be sold in stores. We created a cat toy called the
           Arachnoball that was simply a ball that had spider legs on it
           for cats to be able to chase.
