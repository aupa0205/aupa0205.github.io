    <section tabindex="2">
        <p>One of my hobbies is playing video games!
        I tend to not stick to one game for too long since I like to play
        a lot of different genres. Some of the games I come back to a lot
        or am playing right now are Stellaris, 
        Elden Ring, Helldivers 2,  Warhammer 40k and Halo.</p>

        <p>Another of my hobbies is 3D animation and modeling. I don't
        have a lot of experience yet in it, but what I have done, I've
        really enjoyed. I want to try and make a career out of this and
        hopefully work on some animation in video games in the future!

        <p>I also really enjoy football! My favorite teams are the Colorado
            Buffaloes and the Denver Broncos! I was there through the thick
            and thin for both teams and love watching them play! I have
            season tickets at the Buffs games currently, so you can catch 
            me there!
