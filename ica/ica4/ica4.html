    <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>While creating this little showcase, I think I started to
           understand how HTML and CSS are more than just easy ways to make 
           something look "appaealing" on a webpage. Even thought the assignment
           wasn't too difficult itself, it did help me recognize that design choices
           carry significant weight. Each decision about color, typography, or spacing
           can influence how a user views and experiences content, showing that
           design systems are tools that can help shape communication. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The first critical moment for me was building the color palette.
          Practicing the background and text colors in class made sense, but 
          actually seeing the coolors lined up next to each other with numbers
          in a row gave me a clearer sense of consistency. The palette I chose
          gave my website a more calm, unified feel, I hope. It also helped me
          realize that many of the projects going forward will likely need a good 
          understanding of how this works in order to make an effective website.
        </p>

        <p>
            Typography was another part of the assignment where I feel it taught
            me something bigger. HTML provides heading tags like h1, h2, etc. not
            only to change font size but also give structure and hierarchy to the
            information you want to present. That structure matters for accessibility
            because a screen reader can be used to guide users effectively. What may 
            look like just larger text is actually a good way of signaling importance
            and order. It's as we've mentioned in class before that good code isn't
            just for the person writing it, but can support others with different needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The button and the link styling helped show me how design can
            guide user action. A button that shifts color after hovering over it
            gives feedback to the user, and is a small but meaningful example of
            how design systems support usability by making a use's actions clearer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think this little activity has reinforced for me that design systems
            are about clarity, consistency,and communication. Even though both HTML
            and CSS were simple enough, this has shown how every coding choice is 
            reflective of broader values of accessibility and responsible design.
